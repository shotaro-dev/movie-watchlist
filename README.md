## How this project was built

Initially, with AI(copilot or cursor) tab proposal assistance, I drafted the CSS and HTML.
Afterward, I completed this project through AI-driven development: asking questions, implementing instructions, bug checking, and code critique.
If I don't understand code suggested or generated by AI, ask the AI to explain it, and only adopt it once I'm personally satisfied with the explanation.
Every line was **reviewed, tested, and either kept with confidence or rewritten/deleted by me**  
 → The final code contains only what I'm confident in and take responsibility for
